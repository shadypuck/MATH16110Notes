\begin{axiom}\label{axm:3.1}\marginnote{\emph{10/20:}}
    A continuum is a nonempty set $C$.
\end{axiom}

\begin{definition}\label{dfn:3.1}
    Let $X$ be a set. An \textbf{ordering} on the set $X$ is a subset $<$ of $X\times X$ with elements $(x,y)\in\, <$ written as $x<y$, satisfying the following properties:
    \begin{enumerate}[label={\alph*)},ref={\thetheorem\alph*}]
        \item \label{dfn:3.1a}(\emph{Trichotomy}) For all $x,y\in X$, exactly one of the following holds: $x<y$, $y<x$, or $x=y$.
        \item \label{dfn:3.1b}(\emph{Transitivity}) For all $x,y,z\in X$, if $x<y$ and $y<z$, then $x<z$.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}\label{rmk:3.2}\leavevmode
    \begin{enumerate}[label={\alph*)}]
        \item In mathematics, "or" is understood to be inclusive unless stated otherwise. So in Definition \ref{dfn:3.1a} above, the word "exactly" is needed.
        \item $x<y$ may also be written as $y>x$.
        \item By $x\leq y$, we mean $x<y$ or $x=y$; similarly for $x\geq y$.
        \item We often refer to elements of a continuum $C$ as \textbf{points}.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{remark}

\begin{axiom}\label{axm:3.2}
    A continuum $C$ has an ordering $<$.
\end{axiom}

\begin{definition}\label{dfn:3.3}
    If $A\subset C$, then a point $a\in A$ is a \textbf{first} point of $A$ if for every element $x\in A$, either $a<x$ or $a=x$. Similarly, a point $b\in A$ is called a \textbf{last} point of $A$ if, for every $x\in A$, either $x<b$ or $x=b$.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:3.4}
    If $A$ is a nonempty, finite subset of a continuum $C$, then $A$ has a first and last point.
    \begin{lemma*}
        Let $A$ be a nonempty, finite set \textup{(}i.e., $|A|=n$ for some $n\in\N$\textup{)}, let $a$ be any element of $A$, and let the set $B=A\setminus\{a\}$. Then $|B|=n-1$.
        \begin{proof}
            We first prove that $|\{a\}|=1$. By Definition \ref{dfn:1.33}, to do so, it will suffice to find a bijection $f:\{a\}\to[1]$. Since $[1]=\{1\}$ by Definition \ref{dfn:1.29}, $f:\{a\}\to\{1\}$ defined by $f(a)=1$ is clearly such a bijection. We now demonstrate that $B\cap\{a\}=(A\setminus\{a\})\cap\{a\}=\emptyset$. The previous two results combined with the fact that $B\cup\{a\}=(A\setminus\{a\})\cup\{a\}=A$ imply by Theorem \ref{trm:1.34b} that $|A|=|B|+|\{a\}|$. It follows that $n=|B|+1$, so $|B|=n-1$.
        \end{proof}
    \end{lemma*}
    \begin{proof}[Proof of Lemma \ref{lem:3.4}]
        We consider first points herein (the proof is symmetric for last points). If $A$ is a finite set, then by Definition \ref{dfn:1.30}, $|A|=n$ for some $n\in\N$. Thus, if we prove the claim for each $n\in\N$ individually, we will have proven the claim. To prove a property pertaining to any natural number, we induct on $n$.\par
        For the base case $n=1$, there is only one element (which we may call $a$) in $A$. Since $a=a$, i.e., "for every $x\in A$, either $a<x$ or $a=x$" is a true statement, it follows by Definition \ref{dfn:3.3} that $A$ has a first point. Now suppose inductively that we have proven the claim for $n$, i.e., we know that if $A$ is a nonempty, finite subset of a continuum $C$ with $|A|=n$, then $A$ has a first point. We wish to prove the same claim if $|A|=n+1$. Let $a$ be an arbitrary element of $A$, and consider the set $B=A\setminus\{a\}$. By the lemma, $|B|=n$. Consequently, the induction hypothesis applies and asserts that $B$ has a first point $a_0$. Clearly, $a_0$ is also an element of $A$, but it may or may not be the first point of $A$ (the first point may now be $a$). Since $C$ has an ordering $<$ (see Axiom \ref{axm:3.2}), Definition \ref{dfn:3.1} asserts that either $a<a_0$, $a_0<a$, or $a=a_0$. We now divide into three cases. If $a<a_0$, then since $a_0\leq x$ for all $x\in A$ by Definition \ref{dfn:3.3}, Definition \ref{dfn:3.1} implies that $a\leq x$ for all $x\in A$. Thus, by Definition \ref{dfn:3.3}, $a$ is the first point in $A$, and we have proven the claim for $|A|=n+1$ in this case. If $a_0<a$, then it is still true that $a_0\leq x$ for all $x\in A$. This means by Definition \ref{dfn:3.3} that $a_0$ is still the first point in $A$, proving the claim for $|A|=n+1$ in this case. If $a=a_0$, then $a\in B$, contradicting the fact that $B=A\setminus\{a\}$, so we need not consider this final case. This closes the induction.
    \end{proof}
\end{lemma}

\begin{theorem}\label{trm:3.5}
    Suppose that $A$ is a set of $n$ distinct points in a continuum $C$, or in other words, $A\subset C$ has cardinality $n$. Then the symbols $a_1,\dots,a_n$ may be assigned to each point of $A$ so that $a_1<a_2<\cdots<a_n$, i.e., $a_i<a_{i+1}$ for all $1\leq i\leq n-1$.
    \begin{proof}
        We divide into two cases ($|A|=0$ and $|A|\in\N$).\par
        If $|A|=0$, then the statements "the symbols $a_1,\dots,a_n$ may be assigned to each point of $A$" and "$a_i<a_{i+1}$ for all $1\leq i\leq n-1=-1$" are both vacuously true.\par
        If $|A|\in\N$, we induct on $|A|=n$. For the base case $n=1$, denote the single element of $A$ by $a_1$. Since $a_i<a_{i+1}$ for all $1\leq i\leq n-1=0$ is vacuously true, the base case holds. Now suppose inductively that we have proven the claim for $n$, i.e., for a set $A\subset C$ satisfying $|A|=n$, the symbols $a_1,\dots,a_n$ may be assigned to each point of $A$ so that $a_1<a_2<\cdots<a_n$. We now wish to prove the claim with regards to a set $A\subset C$ with $|A|=n+1$. By Lemma \ref{lem:3.4}, there is a last point $a_{n+1}\in A$, which may be denoted as such (we will rigorously confirm this later). Since the set $A\setminus\{a_{n+1}\}$ has cardinality $n$ (see the lemma from Lemma \ref{lem:3.4}), we have by the induction hypothesis that its $n$ elements can be named $a_1,\dots,a_n$ and ordered $a_1<a_2<\cdots<a_n$. Clearly these $n$ elements are elements of $A$ and all that's left to do is determine where $a_{n+1}$ fits into the established order. But by Definition \ref{dfn:3.3}, $x\leq a_{n+1}$ for all $x\in A$, i.e., $x<a_{n+1}$ for all $x\in A\setminus\{a_{n+1}\}$. Consequently, as its name would suggest, it is true that $a_1<a_2<\cdots<a_n<a_{n+1}$, as desired.
    \end{proof}
\end{theorem}

\begin{definition}\label{dfn:3.6}
    If $x,y,z\in C$ and either (i) both $x<y$ and $y<z$ or (ii) both $z<y$ and $y<x$, then we say that $y$ is \textbf{between} $x$ and $z$.
\end{definition}

\begin{corollary}\label{cly:3.7}
    Of three distinct points in a continuum, one must be between the other two.
    \begin{proof}
        Let $A$ be a subset of the described continuum containing the three distinct points. It follows by Theorem \ref{trm:3.5} that the symbols $a_1,a_2,a_3$ may be assigned to each point of $A$ so that $a_1<a_2<a_3$. Thus, $a_1<a_2$ and $a_2<a_3$, so $a_2$ is between $a_1$ and $a_3$ by Definition \ref{dfn:3.6}.
    \end{proof}
\end{corollary}

\begin{axiom}\label{axm:3.3}
    A continuum $C$ has no first or last point.
\end{axiom}

\begin{definition}\label{dfn:3.8}
    We define an ordering on $\Z$ by $m<n$ if $n=m+c$ for some $c\in\N$.
\end{definition}

\begin{exercise}\label{exr:3.9}\leavevmode
    \begin{enumerate}[label={\alph*)},ref={\thetheorem\alph*}]
        \item \label{exr:3.9a}Prove that with this ordering $\Z$ satisfies Axioms 1-3.
        \begin{proof}
            Clearly, $\Z$ is a nonempty set, so Axiom \ref{axm:3.1} is immediately satisfied.\par
            Axiom \ref{axm:3.2} asserts that $\Z$ must have an ordering $<$. As such, we must verify that the ordering given by Definition \ref{dfn:3.8} satisfies the stipulations of Definition \ref{dfn:3.1}. To prove that $<$ satisfies the trichotomy, it will suffice to show that for all $x,y\in\Z$, exactly one of the following holds: $x<y$, $y<x$, or $x=y$. Let $x,y$ be arbitrary elements of $\Z$. We divide into three cases. First, suppose for the sake of contradiction that $x<y$ and $y<x$. By Definition \ref{dfn:3.8}, this implies that $y=x+c$ and $x=y+c'$ for some $c,c'\in\N$. Substituting, we have $y=y+c'+c$, or $0=c'+c$ by the cancellation law of addition. But since $c',c\in\N$, the closure of addition on $\N$ implies that $(c'+c)\in\N$. Therefore, $c'+c\neq 0$, a contradiction. Second, suppose for the sake of contradiction that $x<y$ and $x=y$. By Definition \ref{dfn:3.8}, this implies that $y=x+c$ for some $c\in\N$. Substituting, we have $y=y+c$, or $0=c$ by the cancellation law of addition. But since $c\in\N$, $c\neq 0$, a contradiction. The proof of the third case ($y<x$ and $x=y$) is symmetric to that of the second case. To prove that $<$ is transitive, it will suffice to show that for all $x,y,z\in\Z$, if $x<y$ and $y<z$, then $x<z$. Let $x,y,z$ be arbitrary elements of $\Z$ for which it is true that $x<y$ and $y<z$. By Definition \ref{dfn:3.8}, we have $y=x+c$ and $z=y+c'$ for some $c,c'\in\N$. Substituting, we have $z=x+c+c'$. Since $(c+c')\in\N$ by the closure of addition on $\N$, Definition \ref{dfn:3.8} implies that $x<z$.\par
            Axiom \ref{axm:3.3} asserts that $\Z$ must have no first or last point. Suppose for the sake of contradiction that $\Z$ has some first point $a$. Then by Definition \ref{dfn:3.3}, $a\leq x$ for every $x\in\Z$. However, under the closure of subtraction on $\Z$, $(a-1)\in\Z$. Since $(a-1)+1=a$, Definition \ref{dfn:3.8} asserts that $a-1<a$, a contradiction. The proof is symmetric for the last point.
        \end{proof}
        \item \label{exr:3.9b}Show that for any $p=\eqclass{a}{b}\in\Q$, there is some $(a_1,b_1)\in p$ with $0<b_1$.
        \begin{proof}
            Let $\eqclass{a}{b}$ be an arbitrary element of $\Q$. It follows by Definition \ref{dfn:2.5} that $(a,b)\in X$. Since we also have $(a,b)\sim(a,b)$ by Exercise \ref{exr:2.2e}, Definition \ref{dfn:2.5} implies that $(a,b)\in\eqclass{a}{b}$. By the trichotomy (see Definition \ref{dfn:3.1}) of the ordering defined by Definition \ref{dfn:3.8} on $\Z$ which Exercise \ref{exr:3.9a} just proved is valid, we have $0<b$, $b<0$, or $0=b$. We divide into three cases. First, suppose that $0<b$. Then $(a,b)$ is an element $(a_1,b_1)\in\eqclass{a}{b}$ for which $0<b_1$, and we are done. Second, suppose that $b<0$. Since $(-a)(b)=(-b)(a)$, we have by the definition of $\sim$ that $(-a,-b)\sim(a,b)$. Additionally, we have by the closure of integer multiplication that $-a,-b\in\Z$, and since $b\neq 0$ by Exercise \ref{exr:2.2e}, $-b\neq 0$. Thus, by Exercise \ref{exr:2.2e}, $(-a,-b)\in X$. This coupled with the previously proven fact that $(-a,-b)\sim(a,b)$ implies by Definition \ref{dfn:2.5} that $(-a,-b)\in\eqclass{a}{b}$. Now recall that $b<0$ by hypothesis, so we may use Definition \ref{dfn:3.8} to see that $b+c=0$ for some $c\in\N$. It follows that $-(b+c)=0$, i.e., $-b-c=0$, i.e., $-b=0+c$, meaning that $0<-b$ by Definition \ref{dfn:3.8}. Thus, $(-a,-b)$ is an element $(a_1,b_1)\in\eqclass{a}{b}$ for which $0<b_1$. Third, suppose that $b=0$. But this contradicts Exercise \ref{exr:2.2e} which asserts that $b\neq 0$, so we need not consider this case.
        \end{proof}
        \item \label{exr:3.9c}Define an ordering $\lQ$ on $\Q$ as follows. For $p,q\in\Q$, let $(a_1,b_1)\in p$ be such that $0<b_1$ and let $(a_2,b_2)\in q$ be such that $0<b_2$. Then we define $p\lQ q$ if $a_1b_2<a_2b_1$. Show that $\lQ$ is a well-defined relation on $\Q$.
        \begin{proof}
            For the relation $\lQ$ to be well-defined, Definition \ref{dfn:3.1} tells us that it must satisfy the trichotomy and be transitive.\par
            To prove that $\lQ$ satisfies the trichotomy, it will suffice to show that for all $p,q\in\Q$, exactly one of the following holds: $p\lQ q$, $q\lQ p$, or $p=q$. Let $p,q$ be arbitrary elements of $\Q$, let $(a,b)\in p$ be such that $0<b$ (we know that such an element exists by Exercise \ref{exr:3.9b}), and let $(c,d)\in q$ be such that $0<d$. We divide into three cases. First, suppose for the sake of contradiction that $p\lQ q$ and $q\lQ p$. Then $ad<bc$ and $cb<da$ by the definition of $\lQ$. But this violates the trichotomy known to hold for the ordering $<$ on the integers by Exercise \ref{exr:3.9a}, a contradiction. Second, suppose for the sake of contradiction that $p\lQ q$ and $p=q$. By the definition of $\lQ$, $ad<bc$. Additionally, by Exercise \ref{exr:2.6}, $(a,b)\sim(c,d)$, implying by Exercise \ref{exr:2.2e} that $ad=bc$. But once again, the simultaneous results that $ad<bc$ and $ad=bc$ violate the trichotomy of the integers, a contradiction. The proof of the third case is symmetric to that of the second.\par
            To prove that $\lQ$ is transitive, it will suffice to show that for all $p,q,r\in\Q$, if $p\lQ q$ and $q\lQ r$, then $p\lQ r$. Let $p,q,r$ be arbitrary elements of $\Q$ for which it is true that $p\lQ q$ and $q\lQ r$, let $(a,b)\in p$ be such that $0<b$, let $(c,d)\in q$ be such that $0<d$, and let $(e,f)\in r$ such that $0<f$. By the definition of $\lQ$, we have $ad<bc$ and $cf<de$. By Definition \ref{dfn:3.8}, this implies that $bc=ad+g$ and $de=cf+g'$ for some $g,g'\in\N$. Thus, by the multiplicative property of equality,
            \begin{align*}
                bcf &= adf+gf&
                bde &= bcf+bg'
            \end{align*}
            so that by the additive property of equality
            \begin{align*}
                bcf+bde &= adf+gf+bcf+bg'\\
                bde &= adf+gf+bg'
            \end{align*}
            Since $0<b$ and $0<f$ for $b,f\in\Z$, we know that $b,f\in\N$. Since $g,g'\in\N$ as well by hypothesis, the closures of multiplication and subsequently of addition for $\N$ guarantee that $(gf+bg')\in\N$. Thus, by Definition \ref{dfn:3.8}, $adf<bde$. Now suppose for the sake of contradiction that $af\not<be$. By Definition \ref{dfn:3.1}, this implies that either $af=be$ or $be<af$. We divide into two cases. First, suppose that $af=be$. Then by the multiplicative property of equality, $adf=bde$, contradicting the fact that $adf<bde$. Second, suppose that $be<af$. Then by Definition \ref{dfn:3.8}, $af=be+g$ for some $g\in\N$. Thus, $adf=bde+gd$ where $gd\in\N$ by the closure of multiplication for the natural numbers ($d\in\N$ since $d\in\Z$ and $0<d$ by hypothesis). Thus, $bcd<adf$ by Definition \ref{dfn:3.8}, contradicting the fact that $adf<bde$. Therefore, it must be true that $af<be$. It follows by the definition of $\lQ$ that $p\lQ r$.
        \end{proof}
        \item \label{exr:3.9d}Show that $\Q$ with the ordering $\lQ$ satisfies Axioms 1-3.
        \begin{proof}
            Clearly, $\Q$ is a nonempty set, so Axiom \ref{axm:3.1} is immediately satisfied.\par
            By Exercise \ref{exr:3.9c}, $\Q$ has an ordering, so Axiom \ref{axm:3.2} is satisfied.\par
            Axiom \ref{axm:3.3} asserts that $\Q$ must have no first or last point. Suppose for the sake of contradiction that $\Q$ has some first point $p$. Then by Definition \ref{dfn:3.3}, $p\lQ x$ or $p=x$ for all $x\in\Q$. Let $(a,b)\in p$ be such that $0<b$ (see Exercise \ref{exr:3.9b}). Under the closure of integer subtraction, $(a-1)\in\Z$, so $\eqclass{a-1}{b}\in\Q$. Since $ba=ba-b+b=b(a-1)+b$ where $b\in\N$ since $b\in\Z$ and $0<b$, Definition \ref{dfn:3.8} implies that $(a-1)b<ba$. It follows by the definition of $\lQ$ that $\eqclass{a-1}{b}\lQ\eqclass{a}{b}=p$, a contradiction. The argument is symmetric for the last point.
        \end{proof}
    \end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}

\begin{definition}\label{dfn:3.10}
    If $a,b\in C$ and $a<b$, then the set of points between $a$ and $b$ is called a \textbf{region} and denoted by $\underline{ab}$.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}\label{rmk:3.11}
    One often sees the notation $(a,b)$ for regions. We will reserve the notation $(a,b)$ for ordered pairs in a product $A\times B$. These are very different things.
\end{remark}

\begin{theorem}\label{trm:3.12}
    If $x$ is a point of a continuum $C$, then there exists a region $\underline{ab}$ such that $x\in\underline{ab}$.
    \begin{proof}
        Let $x$ be an arbitrary point in a continuum $C$. By Axiom \ref{axm:3.2}, $C$ has an ordering $<$, which we will frequently make use of throughout the remainder of this proof. By Axiom \ref{axm:3.3}, $C$ has no first or last points, so it cannot be true that $x\leq y$ for all $y\in C$, nor can it be true that $x\geq y$ for all $y\in C$. This implies that there exists an $a\in C$ such that $a<x$ and that there exists a $b\in C$ such that $b>x$. Since $a<x$ and $x<b$, Definition \ref{dfn:3.6} implies that $x$ is between $a$ and $b$. Note also that by Definition \ref{dfn:3.1} (specifically transitivity), $a<b$. Therefore, since $a,b\in C$, $a<b$, and $x$ is between $a$ and $b$, Definition \ref{dfn:3.10} implies that $x\in\underline{ab}$.
    \end{proof}
\end{theorem}

\begin{definition}\label{dfn:3.13}
    Let $A$ be a subset of a continuum $C$. A point $p$ of $C$ is called a \textbf{limit point} of $A$ if every region $R$ containing $p$ has nonempty intersection with $A\setminus\{p\}$. Explicitly, this means:
    \begin{center}
        for every region $R$ with $p\in R$, we have $R\cap(A\setminus\{p\})\neq\emptyset$.
    \end{center}
    Notice that we do not require that a limit point $p$ of $A$ be an element of $A$. We will use the notation $LP(A)$ to denote the set of limit points of $A$.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}\label{trm:3.14}
    If $p$ is a limit point of $A$ and $A\subset B$, then $p$ is a limit point of $B$.
    \begin{lemma*}
        Let $A,B,C$ be sets such that $A\subset B$. Then $A\cap C\subset B\cap C$.
        \begin{proof}
            Let $x$ be an arbitrary element of $A\cap C$. By Definition \ref{dfn:1.6}, this implies that $x\in A$ and $x\in C$. Since $x\in A$ and $A\subset B$, Definition \ref{dfn:1.3} implies that $x\in B$. Thus, $x\in B$ and $x\in C$, so $x\in B\cap C$ by Definition \ref{dfn:1.6}.
        \end{proof}
    \end{lemma*}
    \begin{proof}
        To prove that a limit point $p$ of $A\subset B$ is a limit point of $B$, Definition \ref{dfn:3.13} tells us that it will suffice to show that for every region $R$ with $p\in R$, we have $R\cap(B\setminus\{p\})\neq\emptyset$. Let $p$ be a limit point of $A$, and let $R$ be an arbitrary region with $p\in R$. Then by Definition \ref{dfn:3.13}, we have $R\cap(A\setminus\{p\})\neq\emptyset$. Thus, by Definition \ref{dfn:1.8}, there is an element $x\in R\cap(A\setminus\{p\})$. Since $A\setminus\{p\}\subset B\setminus\{p\}$ (because $A\subset B$ and $\{p\}=\{p\}$), it follows by the lemma that $R\cap(A\setminus\{p\})\subset R\cap(B\setminus\{p\})$. Consequently, by Definition \ref{dfn:1.3}, the previously referenced object $x\in R\cap(A\setminus\{p\})$ is also an element of $R\cap(B\setminus\{p\})$. Thus, by Definition \ref{dfn:1.8}, $R\cap(B\setminus\{p\})\neq\emptyset$, as desired.
    \end{proof}
\end{theorem}
